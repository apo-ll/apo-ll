Hi there 👋
My name is Evans, I am a Kentan front-end developer and wannabe designer living in Nairobi, Kenya.

I would take whatever you see in these public GitHub repos with a grain of salt.. They are mostly side projects and built with questionable practices and commit hygiene! 😅

Hit me up on twitter if you want to chat! ❤️
